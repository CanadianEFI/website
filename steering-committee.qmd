Guiding CEFI's mission & initiatives 
</h1>
</div>

<div class=content-left>
<br>
The CEFI steering committee was instituted to help the network with the following goals:
<li>Continue to build an engaged community of practice</li>
<li>Formalize guiding values and long-term planning</li>
<li>Support a democratic decision-making process</li>
<li>Improve the sustainability of the network</li>
<li>Continue to create and organize impactful initiatives</li>
<br>
To achieve these goals, the steering committee is formed by 5-10 members and has elections every two years. It aims to include representation from: graduate students and post-doctoral researchers (min. 2), government representatives (min. 2), industry & NGO (min. 2), and academics (remaining seats). All decisions are made by majority vote. The steering committee holds monthly meetings.

University of Guelph<br>
Communications sub-committee<br>
<br>
Chris investigates species interaction networks, focusing on the ecological processes that determine why species interact in particular environments. He aims to apply forecasting techniques to these networks to evaluate their predictive performance and enhance our understanding of species interactions and community dynamics. By identifying and addressing biases in existing network models, Chris strives to improve their accuracy and utility, advancing ecological research.
