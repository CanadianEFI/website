Group projects focused on three case-studies: infectious disease control, fisheries management, or water quality monitoring.\nThe course concluded with group presentations on the models and forecasts developed during the week.\n\n\n  Recorded lectures  Course materials\n \n\nWe are grateful to our partners for funding & support\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nThanks Mateusz Walendzik for the beautiful photo displayed on this page!"

    "text": "Forecasting in the Anthropocene:\n\nAddressing uncertainty in complex-systems using theory, modelling and applied science\n\n\n Ecological forecasting has an imperative role to play in advancing basic science and helping to mitigate impacts arising from human-induced environmental changes. Improving our ability to forecast in uncertain conditions requires additional resources and coordinated efforts between scientists across academia, government, NGOs and industry.\nThanks to the support of CIEE, in 2020 CEFI brought together researchers from academia, industry, NGOs and government to discuss the greatest challenges surrounding predictive ecology when combining theory and practice, and the similarities and differences for generating successful forecasts across different institutions.\n​As an outcome of the working group, we developed a set of guidelines to help researches produce more reliable and useful ecological predictions to inform policy.
