    "text": "A comparative perspective onintegrating ecological forecasting with decision-making\n\nJoint annual meeting for ESA & CSEE, 2022 Montreal, Québec, Canada\n\n\n As the rate of human impact accelerates, A Change Is Gonna Come for social and ecological systems, requiring more rapid and science-based decision-making. Ecological forecasting — the process of predicting changes in ecological systems and their components with specified uncertainties — is useful to assist decision-makers in responding to environmental and societal concerns, even in uncertain conditions. Today, the recent availability of cyberinfrastructure, open-source data and novel techniques have increased opportunities to generate ecological forecasts. However, to design forecasts that are useful for decision-making, forecasts must not only be reliable but also must account for the interests and needs of decision-makers and those affected by the decision-making process. The challenge of accommodating those needs and interests is formidable as even when best practices for integrating forecasts into decision-making are known, mismatches can still occur between idealized practices and those adopted to build forecasting models. Both the development of strategies to tackle the divide between forecasting and decision-making and the challenges of their implementation need to be addressed across different sectors and levels of government.\nIn this session, we began by outlining some of the best practices for bridging the divide between ecological forecasting and decision-making. These proposed best practices were generated by academic, government and industry researchers who have experience building forecasts and/or working with decision-makers. The first talk outlining these practices served as a foundation for the session. Each following speaker focused on a different case study where forecasts were either successfully or unsuccessfully adopted in a decision-making context, and discuss why this outcome occurred. Speakers highlighted practices they perceived to be most beneficial, from using more advanced techniques and quantifying uncertainties, to improving communication and involving decision-makers earlier in the forecasting process, and how successful they were at implementing these practices. As this topic spans across different fields, the speakers in this organized oral session discussed creating forecasts to address a range of issues, from caribou conservation to pandemic planning. Overall, the session highlighted areas of forecasting where we have better succeeded as a scientific community and where we still must work to close the gap between the idealized version of ecological forecasting and the reality of forecasting for decision making.\n\n\n\n\nPresentations\n\n\n\nGuidelines for bridging the divide between ecological forecasts and decision-making\nKorryn Bodner*, Carina Rauen Firkowski, Joseph Bennett, Cole Brookson, Michael Dietze, Stephanie Green, Josie Hughes, Jeremy Kerr, Mélodie Kunegel-Lion, Shawn Leroux, Eliot McIntire, Péter Molnár, Craig Simpkins, E. W. Tekwa, Alexander Watts & Marie-Josée Fortin\n\nAs the world continues to experience rapid human-induced changes, decision-makers are often pressured to respond to environmental and social challenges in uncertain circumstances. Forecasting models are important analytical tools that can help decision-makers prepare for these challenges and will be increasingly used to address a range of issues from species conservation to resource management to disease outbreaks. Here, we outline general best practices for creating forecasts in decision-making contexts. These best practices were developed through a working group and are based on the experiences of researchers working in academia, government, and industry.\nOur best practices encompass strategies for better model development at the science-policy interface. They range from specific technical practices such as quantifying uncertainties, building adaptable models, and creating reusable code, to soft skill practices such as building diverse teams, developing communication techniques, and addressing biases for different audiences. We also categorize strategies based on the time and resources required to implement them, providing first and next steps for researchers desiring to begin or further invest in forecasting. Lastly, we highlight some of the main external obstacles that can prevent good forecasting practices from being adopted in reality. This talk serves as the foundation for this oral session and will provide the benchmarks to evaluate where the forecasting community has most succeeded in integrating forecasting and decision-making, and where future effort should be focused.\n\n\nForecasting cumulative effects of anticipated resource development on wildlife and vegetation in the James Bay Lowlands of northern Ontario, Canada\nJosie Hughes*, Frances Stewart, Jennifer Baltzer, Lisa Venier, Stephanie Avery-Gomm, Raquel Alfaro-Sánchez, Alex Chubaty, Steven Cumming, Sarah Endicott, Leonardo Frid, Cheryl Johnson, Samantha McFarlane, Eliot McIntire & Philip Wiebe\n\nThe James Bay Lowlands in Northern Ontario, Canada, falls within one of the largest areas of intact wetlands on the planet, containing one of the largest soil carbon stores. The region is home to Indigenous peoples and wildlife, including the threatened boreal woodland caribou. It is presently inaccessible by road. There is an urgent need to assess the potential environmental impacts of proposed mining of ‘Ring of Fire’ mineral deposits. Challenges for forecasting regional cumulative impacts of mining development and ongoing climate warming on vegetation and caribou include: lack of baseline information on the distribution and dynamics of vegetation, natural disturbance regimes, and the distribution, status, and behaviour of wildlife; the cost and logistical difficulty of data collection in remote areas; a lack of ethical space for engagement among scientists and Indigenous communities; and lack of quantitative models of peatland vegetation dynamics.\nWe used available models of vegetation dynamics and caribou responses to explore a framework for integrating models into a decision support tool. We use this tool to highlight the needs and possibilities for impact assessment in the region, to identify opportunities for baseline data collection, to begin building partnerships, and to demonstrate the potential for open, modular decision support tools to better integrate ecological knowledge into decision making.\n\n\nForecasting Pacific salmon recruitment using empirical dynamic modeling\nLuke Rogers*, Andrew Edwards & Carrie Holt\n\nAttractor reconstruction offers a tantalizing suite of methods to forecast wildlife abundance. Empirical dynamic modeling (EDM) and the closely related multiview embedding (MVE) match recent abundance patterns with similar patterns in the past to forecast abundance in the future. This allows forecasting to proceed without structural assumptions about the relationship between response and explanatory variables. Further, these methods offer a natural way to include environmental covariates among the explanatory variables. Including environmental covariates in single-species assessments and forecasting is a major focus of the ecosystem approach to fisheries management (EAFM), a stepping stone to multi-species ecosystem-based management (EBM). However, empirical dynamic modeling and related methods are often data-intensive, opaque to users, and deployed in unrealistic forecast settings. We ask, do empirical dynamic modeling and multiview embedding outperform conventional model-based methods to forecast sockeye salmon recruitment abundance in the Fraser River? We used 65 years of spawner abundance and four environmental covariates to forecast 20 years of recruitment abundance in 10 sockeye salmon stocks. We developed an R package where the code for these methods is visible to the public. We forecast recruitment each year using only previous data, mimicking real-world forecasting scenarios, and compared forecasts using accepted forecast metrics.\n\n\nTales from the trenches: Modelling and pandemic preparedness and response in Canada\nAmy Greer*\n\nAs we emerge from the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic commissions will be convened to dissect the decisions that were made by organizations, and governments. Decision-makers have both the opportunity and responsibility to meet the critical challenges of public health emergencies. Past inquiries, including the one conducted following SARS-CoV-1 have drawn attention to the need for robust critical thinking and the use of the precautionary principle during times of crisis.\nBehavioural economics has demonstrated that all decision-makers are influenced by their beliefs, biases, and other constraints when making choices. Yet, our primary response has been to call for improved transparency around decision-making. I would argue that transparency alone is not enough. We need to embrace more structured approaches that can be used to better engineer the decision-making environment when communicating modelling results to decision-makers and knowledge users. The role of infectious disease modelling in Canadian pandemic preparedness and response activities in 2003 (SARS-CoV-1), 2009 (pandemic influenza A, H1N1), and 2022 (SARS-CoV-2) represents a unique case study with which to consider how forecasts inform decision-making with a specific focus on successes and failures.\nAs we head into the post-mortem pandemic period, reviews of our pandemic modelling and response across all sectors will clearly demonstrate that we must better support and structure decision-making environments that mitigate the impact of cognitive bias. We must consider the possibility that employing a more structured framework for decision environments would improve processes and policy decisions. Public health relies heavily on risk communication within organizations and between leaders and the public. The integration of the best available empirical evidence from epidemiology, public health, mathematics, and statistics combined with psychology and behavioural economics can support the creation of an institutional culture of transparency around decision-making that will better enable models to guide policy change.\n\n\nTrait‐based vulnerability reveals hotspots of potential impact for a global marine invader\nStephanie Green*, Cole Brookson & Christi Linardich\n\nMitigating and anticipated ecological and economic impacts of biological invasion before they occur requires knowledge products that identify the types of effects most likely to manifest and where these effects might be most intense. Predation from the invasive Indo-Pacific lionfish is likely to amplify declines in marine fishes observed in multiple ocean basins. As the invasion intensifies and expands, there is an urgent need to identify species that are most at risk for extirpation—and possible extinction—from this added threat. To address this gap and inform conservation plans, we develop and apply a quantitative framework for classifying the relative vulnerability of fishes based on morphological and behavioural traits known to influence susceptibility to lionfish predation (e.g. body shape, water column position and aggregation behaviour), habitat overlap with lionfish, and degree of geographic range restriction. We use this framework to forecast the vulnerability of fish communities across the invaded range and head of the invasion front.\nApplying the framework to fishes across the invaded Caribbean Sea and ahead of the invasion front in the southwestern Atlantic revealed the identity of at least 77 fishes with relatively small ranges that are likely to be most affected by lionfish predation. Trait-based vulnerability scores significantly predict the probability of fishes appearing within the diets of lionfish across the invaded region. Spatial richness analyses reveal hotspots of vulnerable species in the Bahamas, Belize and Curaçao. Crucially, our framework identifies 29 vulnerable fishes endemic to Brazil, which has not yet been colonized by lionfish. Of these, we suggest reefs around offshore island groups occupied by a dozen highly vulnerable and range-restricted species as priorities for intervention should lionfish spread to the region. Observations of the rate of lionfish spread across the invaded range suggest that an average of 5 years (with a median of nearly 2 years) elapses from first sighting to maximum observed densities. This lag may allow managers to mobilize plans to suppress lionfish ahead of an invasion front in priority locations. Our framework also provides a method for assessing the relative vulnerability of cryptobenthic and/or deep-reef fishes, for which population-monitoring data are limited.\n\n\nContributing to caribou land management plans in northern ecosystems while data, models, objectives and the ecosystems are in flux\nEliot McIntire*, Tati Micheletti, Ceres Barros, Frances Stewart, Ian Eddy, Celine Boisvenue, Junior Tremblay, Mathieu Leblond, Alex Chubaty, Steven Cumming, Alana Westwood, Trevor Teed, James Hodson & Samuel Hache\n\nApplied ecological sciences face two major, accelerating challenges: a world with rapid socio-ecological changes and an influx of data and models. Under these conditions, developing ecological forecasts that are sufficiently reliable, responsive and flexible to the needs of rights holders, policy makers, land managers, stakeholders and the public is extremely difficult. It is necessary to develop an ecological forecasting approach that can keep pace with changes to all these variables. Recently, McIntire et al (Ecology Letters, 2022) introduced the PERFICT approach, a clear framework based on nimble yet robust workflows linking management objectives, data, ecological models and results.\nTo demonstrate this approach, we present the Western Boreal Initiative as a case study. This multi-year ecological forecasting project initially located in the territory of the Dene Nation and other First Peoples (also known as the Northwest Territories, Canada) includes co-production of knowledge between Indigenous and non-Indigenous researchers to support woodland caribou recovery planning. Over the first 2 years of the project, the project objectives, the datasets and the models have frequently been updated or changed; many more such changes are anticipated, exemplifying the need for the PERFICT approach.\nDespite forecasts of increased rates of disturbance under climate change, our modelling suggests that caribou populations in the Northwest Territories’ boreal forests could remain stable, in spite of notable changes to habitat. Although several dimensions of this complex issue have not yet been fully woven into our results, our approach allows us to integrate these changes to help bring the most up-to-date data to decisions while enabling the active involvement of all partners. By sharing this approach, we demonstrate some challenges and possible solutions for an applied ecological problem that can be nimble enough for a world under constant flux.\n\n\n(*) Presenting authors\n\n \n\nThanks James Wheeler for the beautiful photo displayed on this page ☺"

    "text": "Prediction in the Anthropocene: Combining theory and practice\n\nCSEE annual meeting, 2019 Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada\n\n\n Climate change, species invasion, overexploitation, and land-use change continue to intensify pressures on ecosystems worldwide. Increasingly, scientists across disciplines face the challenging task of creating reliable predictions in dynamic and complex natural systems. Reliable forecasting is a key strategy to help mitigate the negative consequences arising from anthropogenic impacts. In this symposium, we bring together researchers working at the interface of science and practice, under the common objective of predicting into an uncertain future. The pairing of theoretical advancements and practical application is essential for making progress under complex and uncertain conditions. While well-informed theory allows us to project into novel situations, collaborative work with practitioners allows us to address priorities and facilitate policy-relevant predictions. In an effort to identify commonalities and differences in theoretical and applied approaches of predicting in the Anthropocene, this symposium encompasses a diverse range of ecosystems (including marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) and various taxa. Additionally, we plan to draw upon research based on diverse techniques, using data from both observational and experimental work. We hope this symposium will lead to a greater exchange of ideas and tools to help further bridge the gap between theoretical and applied science, and to support the continued preservation and management of current and future environments.\n\n\n\n\nPresentations\n\n\n\nValue of information for threatened species management: Predicting where and when we should monitor versus act\nJoseph Bennett, Carleton University\n\nAccurate information on remaining populations of threatened species can be vital for effective management. We can undertake surveys to help find these populations, and we can build models to predict where they may exist. However, the rarer a species becomes, the harder it is to find and model. And gathering information takes time and financial resources that could be used in managing for recovery. How do we know when have we monitored enough that it makes sense to act? Where are the optimal places to monitor, so we can best inform action? Using Canadian case studies, I will present research on value of information theory that can help to solve these problems, and ultimately, better achieve recovery of threatened species. I will also discuss theoretical problems of monitoring for immediate management needs, versus monitoring to improve overall knowledge of a system, and possible strategies to achieve a balance between these approaches.\n\n\nInvestigating the effects of microplastics and their associated chemicals to fathead minnows at multiple levels of biological organization\nKennedy Bucci, University of Toronto\n\nDue to the pervasiveness of microplastics (plastic &lt; 5 mm) in aquatic environments, the public, scientists, and decision-makers often ask whether microplastics pose an ecological threat. However, investigation into the effects of microplastics to aquatic organisms is often conducted using simplistic scenarios that do not capture the reality of microplastics as a complex contaminant. These studies generally investigate effects by exposing low trophic-level species to extremely high concentrations of pristine microspheres. The goal of my project is to investigate how environmentally relevant concentrations and types of microplastics affect fathead minnows at multiple levels of biological organization. Fathead minnows were exposed to fragments of virgin polyethylene and polyethylene collected from the shore of Lake Ontario at two concentrations: 100 and 2400 particles per L. The exposure began at the egg stage, 24 hours post-fertilization, and will last until all breeding groups from the control treatment have laid at least 1000 eggs (5-7 months). Throughout this experiment, I will be investigating effects at the suborganismal-level (e.g., histopathology, gene expression), the individual-level (e.g., survival, length, body condition), and the population level (e.g., reproductive success, sex characteristics). I will also be quantifying length, deformities, and epigenetic effects in offspring. Results to date will be presented at this conference.\n\n\nNitrogen addition enhances terrestrial phosphorous retention\nDr. Ellen Esch, University of Guelph\n\nNutrient availability influences ecosystem function ranging from biomass production to nutrient retention. In tandem, nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) availability may be particularly influential on ecosystem function given widespread prevalence of colimitation dynamics. Within 200 experimental mesocosms, variable amounts of N and P were applied to plant communities consisting of either 1 or 2 functional groups, with leachate collected for 3 months following fertilization. We found (i) that N fertilizer additions reduced P leaching losses, but there was no reciprocal effect of P fertilizer enhancing N retention. Mechanistically, increased plant biomass under N fertilization mediated this effect, pointing towards higher biotic demand for P in the absence of N limitation. (ii) Retention levels were in excess of 95% for N and P across all treatments, and (iii) despite high retention, nutrient runoff was in excess of recommended guidelines for safe drinking water and above levels known to support harmful algal blooms. While our results that adding N can promote P uptake, and hence reduce P leaching, are in line with resource limitation theories, we stress that more research should refine the interactions between N and P availability and leaching at low levels of P addition.\n\n\nHabitat suitability of avian functional groups in current and future land use scenarios in urban environments\nAndrew Chin, Toronto and Region Conservation Authority\n\nConsequences of urbanization, such as land use conversion or intensification and natural cover loss, may have both local and regional scales of impact resulting in biodiversity loss and degradation. Therefore, understanding effects of how the current land use changes affect species may help better manage future biodiversity loss. Here we use functional trait groups of species relating to their habitat needs and requirements to assess the status of biodiversity functions in urban environments. Specifically, we focused on two avian functional groups of forest canopy foragers/nesters, and aerial insectivore foragers with data collected from 2007-2017 by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority, Ontario. We used the amount of land use, vegetation communities, and habitat connectivity as predictors of habitat suitability in the Greater Toronto Area. We used boosted regression trees to model habitat suitability under the current landscape’s capacity to identify where in the landscape support the highest capacity for each functional group. The current landscape’s capacity was compared to the habitat suitability in the future landscape’s capacity based on official plans that will result in land use and cover changes. We found that habitat connectivity mainly influenced habitat suitability and, thus, was an influential factor in current and future scenarios.\n\n\nFactors governing outbreak dynamics in a forest managed for mountain pine beetle\nMélodie Kunegel-Lion, University of Alberta\n\nMountain pine beetle (MPB) outbreaks have caused major economic losses and ecological damages in North American pine forests. Using ecological and environmental factors impacting MPB life-history and stands susceptibility can help with the detection of MPB infested trees and thereby, improve control. Temperatures, water stress, host characteristics, and beetle pressure are among those ecological and environmental factors. They have different roles on MPB population dynamics at various stages of an outbreak. However, a deeper quantitative analysis on a local scale is required to make detailed connections between ecological and environmental variables and MPB outbreak phases. We studied the current isolated MPB outbreak in Cypress Hills. We used logistic regressions on a highly-detailed and georeferenced data set to determine the factors driving MPB infestations for the different phases of an outbreak. We showed that incoming flights from outside the park are driving MPB population increase during the outbreak onset more than a change in stand susceptibility. At its peak, the MPB outbreak depends mainly on nearby beetle pressure, low summer temperatures, and the presence of tall trees. A decrease in the number of vigorous susceptible pines, as suggested by lower relative humidity levels and a decrease in pine cover, drives the MPB population collapse. This can help managers make appropriate decisions on where to focus their effort depending on which phase the outbreak is in.\n\n\nModeling scenarios for forest restoration after moose (Alces alces) overbrowsing\nMeghan Noonan, Memorial University of Newfoundland\n\nWithin degraded landscapes, forests are failing to naturally regenerate, resulting in a loss of key species and producing persistent open canopied patches within previously closed canopied systems. Hyper-abundant ungulates can act as a disturbance and hinder natural forest regeneration when they severely overbrowse vegetation. In Newfoundland (Canada), hyper-abundant moose have suppressed balsam fir advanced regeneration producing alternate stable states. We integrated data from field observations and experiments, aerial photographs and drone imagery to parameterize mathematical models of boreal understory and canopy regeneration in Newfoundland. We used simulations to evaluate several restoration scenarios for moose impacted forests, including reduced browsing pressure and seedling planting. Model outcomes suggest active restoration via planting birch and balsam fir seedlings is required to restore the understory and canopy vegetation to its natural state in large canopy gaps, and any planting should be done under low moose browsing pressure or within moose exclosures. In small canopy gaps, passive restoration via moose reduction is sufficient to restore balsam fir, however, birch seedling planting is still required to reach historic birch targets. The study found that Markov models parameterized by aggregate data with simulated herbivory can be used to support experimental studies and strengthen evidence for restoration planning.\n\n\nProjecting the cumulative effects of harvest, fire and roads on forests and boreal caribou: A northwestern Ontario example\nJosie Hughes, Environment and Climate Change Canada\n\nAn important factor in the decline of boreal woodland caribou is disturbance mediated apparent competition; disturbance improves conditions for predators and alternate prey. We use a spatial stochastic model of forest harvest, fire, succession, and road development to project the cumulative effects of ongoing disturbance in the Churchill range (Northwestern Ontario) of boreal woodland caribou. Succession and harvest parameters are derived from inputs and outputs of existing operational planning models. Without fire or roads our model matches operational plans, and projects an increase in disturbance? from 18% to between 30 and 37% of the landscape within 500m of a cutblock after 40 years. Adding initial roads and fires increases total disturbance to between 59 and 66% after 40 years. Most trunk roads have already been built, so road projections have little impact. A dynamic caribou habitat supply policy and a natural disturbance emulation policy both aggregate harvest. Removing either policy alone has little effect but dispersing small (&lt; 100 ha) cutblocks would increase the total disturbance footprint to between 80 and 85%. Climate change is expected to further increase fire disturbance. Spatial stochastic projections derived from operational planning models allow us to assess the implications of plans for caribou using the language of management.\n\n\nPredicting caribou resource selection and demography under landscape and climate change\nFrances Stewart, Natural Resources Canada\n\nClimate change, species invasion, overexploitation, and land-use change continue to intensify pressures on ecosystems worldwide. Increasingly, scientists across disciplines face the challenging task of creating reliable predictions in dynamic and complex natural systems. Reliable forecasting is a key strategy to help mitigate the negative consequences arising from anthropogenic impacts. In this symposium, we bring together researchers working at the interface of science and practice, under the common objective of predicting into an uncertain future. The pairing of theoretical advancements and practical application is essential for making progress under complex and uncertain conditions. While well-informed theory allows us to project into novel situations, collaborative work with practitioners allows us to address priorities and facilitate policy-relevant predictions. In an effort to identify commonalities and differences in theoretical and applied approaches of predicting in the Anthropocene, this symposium encompasses a diverse range of ecosystems (including marine, freshwater, and terrestrial) and various taxa. Additionally, we plan to draw upon research based on diverse techniques, using data from both observational and experimental work. We hope this symposium will lead to a greater exchange of ideas and tools to help further bridge the gap between theoretical and applied science, and to support the continued preservation and management of current and future environments.\n\n\nConsequences of linked genomic architectures for population responses to environmental change\nRebekah Oomen, University of Oslo\n\nRecent advances in both next-generation sequencing technologies and eco-evolutionary modelling are unlocking the potential for integrating genomic information into predictions of population responses to environmental change. One key aspect in this regard is genomic architecture: the structural characteristics and associated inheritance models of genes underlying adaptive traits. For example, whether a trait is controlled primarily by a single locus or multiple loci will greatly influence its evolution in response to environmental stressors. As single-locus control of complex traits is thought to be rare, eco-evolutionary models typically assume many unlinked loci are involved in adaptation. Yet, blocks of physically linked genes that undergo little or no recombination, such as those associated with some chromosomal rearrangements, have emerged as taxonomically widespread phenomena that can facilitate rapid adaptation, especially in the face of gene flow. Inheritance of linked genomic architectures resembles that of single loci, thus enabling single-locus-like modeling of polygenic adaptation. We develop single-locus evolutionary theory for adaptive traits largely controlled by multiple linked loci for the purpose of predicting responses of natural populations to directional environmental stressors, such as climate change and harvesting. We review known systems for which such an approach might be useful and discuss barriers to implementation.\n\n\n\n \n\nThanks Jared Rover for the beautiful photo displayed on this page ☺"

    "text": "Guiding CEFI’s mission & initiatives\n\n\n\n The CEFI steering committee was instituted to help the network with the following goals:\n\nContinue to build an engaged community of practice\n\n\nFormalize guiding values and long-term planning\n\n\nSupport a democratic decision-making process\n\n\nImprove the sustainability of the network\n\n\nContinue to create and organize impactful initiatives\n\n To achieve these goals, the steering committee is formed by 5-10 members and has elections every two years. It includes representation from: graduate students and post-doctoral researchers (min. 2), government representatives (min. 2), industry & NGO (min. 2), and academics (remaining seats). All decisions are made by majority vote. The steering committee holds monthly meetings.\n\n\n\n\nMembers\n\n2025-2027\n\n\n\n\n Korryn Bodner University of Guelph Chair  Korryn is interested in combining near-term forecasting with One Health to predict and prevent the emergence and spread of infectious diseases that impact wildlife, domestic animals, and humans.
